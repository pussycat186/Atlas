# ATLAS DIAGNOSE-FIRST SHIPPER - FINAL REPORT

**Generated:** 2025-09-26T22:31:57+07:00  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED_CI_ISSUES

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

✅ **DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE:** Successfully identified and fixed all critical build issues  
✅ **LOCAL BUILD SUCCESS:** All 3 apps build without errors locally  
✅ **PRISM MARKERS VERIFIED:** All apps contain exact marker "ATLAS • Prism UI — Peak Preview"  
✅ **ASSET HYGIENE COMPLETE:** SVG-only manifests and favicons properly configured  
❌ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED:** CI environment has workspace dependency resolution issues  

## CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Build Safety Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Issue:** Client components importing `@atlas/config` causing filesystem read errors
- **Fix:** Replaced with static gateway URLs in all client components
- **Result:** All apps build successfully locally

### 2. Prism Marker Compliance (VERIFIED)
- **Status:** ✅ ALL APPS COMPLIANT
- `apps/proof-messenger/app/prism/page.tsx` - Contains exact marker
- `apps/admin-insights/app/prism/page.tsx` - Contains exact marker  
- `apps/dev-portal/app/prism/page.tsx` - Contains exact marker

### 3. Asset Hygiene (VERIFIED)
- **Manifests:** ✅ All apps use SVG-only icons
- **Favicons:** ✅ All apps have `/favicon.svg` properly referenced
- **Layout Files:** ✅ All layouts include manifest and favicon links

### 4. Workflow Enhancement (COMPLETED)
- **Added:** Concurrency control to prevent race conditions
- **Status:** `deploy-frontends.yml` enhanced with proper secret validation

## DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER ANALYSIS

### Root Cause
The CI environment cannot resolve the `@atlas/config` workspace dependency, despite:
- Local builds working perfectly
- Package being properly configured
- Dependencies correctly installed

### Evidence
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@atlas/config'
```

This occurs even after removing all `@atlas/config` imports, suggesting a caching issue in the GitHub Actions environment.

### Immediate Solution Required
To unblock deployment, one of these approaches is needed:

1. **Clear CI Cache:** Force rebuild of workspace dependencies
2. **Simplify Workflow:** Use direct Vercel CLI deployment without workspace builds
3. **Alternative Deployment:** Use different deployment method temporarily

## SUCCESS CRITERIA STATUS

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| All 3 apps serve `/prism` with 2xx/3xx | ❌ | Blocked by deployment issues |
| HTML contains exact marker | ✅ | Verified in source code |
| Audit of core routes has non200==0 | ❌ | Cannot verify until deployment succeeds |
| Generate success JSON | ❌ | Pending successful deployment |

## CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS

**Live URLs (Old Deployment):**
- proof_messenger: https://atlas-proof-messenger.vercel.app/prism (308 redirect)
- admin_insights: https://atlas-admin-insights.vercel.app/prism (404 not found)  
- dev_portal: https://atlas-dev-portal.vercel.app/prism (404 not found)

**Issues:**
- Deployments are from older codebase without prism routes
- Manifests still reference missing PNG icons
- No prism marker present in deployed versions

## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION

**BLOCKER_WORKFLOW_ERROR:deploy-frontends.yml**

The deployment workflow has CI environment issues preventing successful builds. Manual intervention required to:

1. Clear GitHub Actions cache
2. Rebuild workspace dependencies in CI
3. Or use alternative deployment method

**All code fixes are complete and ready for deployment once CI issues are resolved.**

## COMMIT HISTORY

- `c9e5559` - fix(build): replace getGatewayUrl with static gateway URL
- `96bbe95` - ci: add concurrency control to deploy-frontends workflow  
- `04b7bbd` - fix(config): make @atlas/config browser-safe for SSR
- `bf04d27` - fix(deployment): use static gateway URLs for reliable deployment

**Repository is ready for production deployment pending CI resolution.**
