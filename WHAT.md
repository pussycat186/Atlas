# WHAT - ATLAS Monorepo Hardening

## Overview
This document describes what changes were made to the ATLAS monorepo during the hardening process.

## Phase 0 - Inventory & Baseline
- **Generated comprehensive inventory** of the monorepo structure, packages, services, and dependencies
- **Created baseline reports** documenting current performance thresholds and system state
- **Analyzed dependencies** using knip, ts-prune, and dependency-cruiser tools
- **Documented current configuration** including Node.js versions, TypeScript settings, and Docker setup

## Phase 1 - Clean Sweep
- **Identified 31 unused files** including unused React components, scripts, and generated files
- **Found 39 unused dependencies** across all packages and services
- **Created DELETION_REPORT.md** with detailed analysis of safe deletion candidates
- **Built scripts/cleanup.sh** for automated, idempotent cleanup process
- **Estimated ~50MB space savings** from cleanup operations

## Phase 2 - Monorepo Strictness
### Root Configuration
- **Enforced Node 20** requirement across all packages
- **Enhanced TypeScript strictness** with incremental builds and additional strict flags
- **Unified ESLint/Prettier** configuration across the monorepo
- **Added comprehensive linting rules** for code quality and consistency

### Package Centralization
- **Centralized protocol schemas** in `packages/fabric-protocol` using Zod validation
- **Enhanced fabric-client SDK** with idempotency, retry logic, and schema validation
- **Unified API contracts** across all services using shared schemas

### Service Hardening
#### Gateway Service
- **Added structured Pino logging** with request tracing and performance metrics
- **Implemented idempotency cache** with 60-second TTL and automatic cleanup
- **Added rate limiting** (1000 requests/minute) with proper error responses
- **Enhanced health endpoint** with memory usage and cache statistics
- **Added metrics endpoint** for observability and monitoring
- **Implemented Zod schema validation** for all API endpoints
- **Added Idempotency-Key header support** for request deduplication

#### Witness Node Service
- **Enforced quorum parameters** {N=5, q=4, Δ≤2000ms} with timestamp skew validation
- **Implemented deterministic append-only ledger** behavior
- **Added observed skew tracking** in witness attestations
- **Enhanced logging** with structured Pino output and witness-specific context
- **Added fabric config support** for quorum parameters and validation

## Phase 3 - Observability
- **Added OpenTelemetry instrumentation** to all services
- **Created comprehensive observability stack** with OTEL Collector, Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana
- **Implemented metrics endpoints** for all services
- **Added distributed tracing** with OTLP export
- **Created monitoring dashboards** for system health and performance

## Phase 4 - CI/CD & Supply Chain
### CI/CD Pipelines
- **ci-build-test.yml**: Build, test, lint, type-check, and security scanning
- **ci-observe.yml**: Observability testing with health checks and trace validation
- **ci-perf.yml**: Performance testing with k6 (500 RPS, p95 ≤200ms, error <1%)
- **ci-cleanup-verify.yml**: Cleanup script verification and safety checks
- **ci-release.yml**: Release automation with supply chain security

### Supply Chain Security
- **Container image signing** with cosign keyless signatures
- **SLSA provenance generation** for build artifacts
- **SBOM generation** in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats
- **SHA256 manifest** for artifact integrity verification
- **GitHub Container Registry** integration for secure image distribution

## Phase 5 - Evidence Pack
- **Generated comprehensive artifacts** including k6 performance results
- **Created trace ID screenshots** from Grafana/Tempo dashboards
- **Documented all configurations** and changes made
- **Verified all thresholds** and performance gates

## Key Improvements
1. **Code Quality**: Strict TypeScript, unified linting, comprehensive validation
2. **Performance**: Idempotency caching, rate limiting, optimized builds
3. **Security**: Input validation, supply chain security, vulnerability scanning
4. **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, distributed tracing
5. **Reliability**: Quorum enforcement, deterministic behavior, error handling
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized schemas, automated cleanup, comprehensive testing

## Backward Compatibility
- **All existing APIs preserved** with legacy endpoint support
- **No breaking changes** to public interfaces
- **Gradual migration path** for clients to use new features
- **Comprehensive testing** to ensure no regressions

## Files Modified
- Root configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc.js)
- Service implementations (gateway, witness-node)
- Package schemas and client SDK
- CI/CD workflows and observability stack
- Documentation and reporting files

## Dependencies Added
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages
- Rate limiting and validation libraries
- Security scanning and supply chain tools
- Performance testing and monitoring tools
