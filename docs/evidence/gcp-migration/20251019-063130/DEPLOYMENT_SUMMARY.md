# GCP Migration One-Prompt Orchestrator - Deployment Complete

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-19T06:31:30Z  
**Status**: ✅ **ORCHESTRATOR DEPLOYED AND READY**  
**Commit**: `b55d75d`  
**Branch**: `main`

---

## 🎯 Mission Complete

A complete **single-workflow GCP migration orchestrator** has been successfully created and deployed to GitHub. This workflow executes the entire Vercel → GCP Cloud Run migration in one automated pipeline.

---

## 📦 What Was Deployed

### 1. Main Orchestrator Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/atlas-gcp-migrate-oneshot.yml` (1,160 lines)

**Stages**: 14 jobs (S0-S17)
- S0: Secrets audit
- S1: Repository patches (Next.js configs + Dockerfiles)
- S2: Infrastructure scripts (bootstrap, domains, secrets)
- S3: Build & push (3 Docker images)
- S4: Cloud Run deploy (3 services)
- S5: Domain mapping (SSL + HTTPS LB)
- S6: Security headers validation
- S7: Quality gates (availability, LHCI, k6, Playwright)
- S8: Supply chain (SBOM, SLSA, Cosign)
- S9: Promote to 100% traffic (or rollback)
- S10: Operational schedules (monitoring workflows)
- S12: Vietnamese UX validation
- S14: Vercel decommission plan
- S17: Finalize (FINAL.json + live URLs)

**Features**:
- ✅ OIDC authentication (Workload Identity Federation)
- ✅ Evidence collection at each stage
- ✅ Auto-rollback on failure
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to re-run)
- ✅ Zero local dependencies

### 2. Trigger File
**File**: `.atlas/autorun/gcp-20251019-062900.txt`

**Purpose**: Auto-triggers workflow on next push to `main`

**Contents**:
- Complete workflow overview
- Required/optional secrets guide
- Stage-by-stage breakdown
- Monitoring instructions
- Evidence collection details

## 🔐 Required Secrets (Must Configure)

Navigate to: **https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/settings/secrets/actions**

| # | Secret Name | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | `GH_ADMIN_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT with repo admin permissions |
| 2 | `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project ID |
| 3 | `GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER` | GCP project number |
| 4 | `GCP_REGION` | Deployment region (e.g., `asia-southeast1`) |
| 5 | `GCP_WORKLOAD_ID_PROVIDER` | WIF provider full path |
| 6 | `GCP_DEPLOYER_SA` | Service account email |
| 7 | `ARTIFACT_REPO` | Artifact Registry repository name |
| 8 | `DOMAINS_JSON` | JSON: `{"proof_messenger":"domain.com",...}` |

**Once configured**, the workflow will:
1. Validate all secrets (S0)
2. Proceed with full migration (S1-S17)
3. Output: `GCP_MIGRATION_DONE`

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add all 8 required secrets
   
2. **Monitor Workflow Execution**
   - Dashboard: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions
   - Workflow will auto-trigger on next push to main (trigger file already exists)

### After Migration (Post-Execution)
1. **Verify Services** (Day 1)
   - Test all 3 service URLs from `FINAL.json`
   - Verify Vietnamese text on proof-messenger
   - Check security headers

2. **Monitor Stability** (Days 1-7)
   - Watch Cloud Run logs
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check costs and scaling

3. **Decommission Vercel** (Days 7-30)
   - Follow `docs/VERCEL_DECOMMISSION_PLAN.md`
   - 7-day park period for rollback safety
   - Final deletion after Day 30

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Secrets Validation**: S0 checks all 8 required secrets before proceeding
- **Permission Checks**: Each GCP API call validates IAM roles
- **Auto-Rollback**: S9 automatically reverts on validation failures
- **Evidence Trail**: Every stage creates JSON evidence files
- **Idempotent**: Safe to re-run multiple times
- **7-Day Park Period**: Vercel rollback available for 7 days post-migration
