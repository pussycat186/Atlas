## EXECUTION PLAN

### **BLOCKER:** GitHub CLI Not Available

**Issue:** Cannot programmatically trigger GitHub Actions workflows  
**Impact:** Manual execution required via GitHub UI  
**Resolution:** Follow step-by-step guide in `ATLAS_PERFECT_MODE_FINAL_CUT_EXECUTE.md`

### Manual Execution Sequence

**1. Deploy Frontends**
```
URL: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions/workflows/deploy-frontends.yml
Action: Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" → Run
Duration: ~10-15 minutes
Output: 3 Vercel deployment URLs
```

**2. Validate Headers** (REQUIRES URLs from step 1)
```
URL: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions/workflows/atlas-perfect-live-validation.yml
Action: Click "Run workflow" → Input URLs → Run
Duration: ~5 minutes
Output: Security header validation report (all PASS)
```

**3. Quality Gates**
```
URL: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions/workflows/atlas-quality-gates.yml
Action: Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" → Run
Duration: ~20-30 minutes
Output: Lighthouse, k6, Playwright results (all ≥90 / PASS)
```

**4. Policy Check**
```
URL: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions/workflows/policy-check.yml
Action: Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" → Run
Duration: ~5 minutes
Output: OPA policy evaluation (0 violations)
```

**5. Acceptance & Evidence**
```
URL: https://github.com/pussycat186/Atlas/actions/workflows/atlas-acceptance.yml
Action: Click "Run workflow" → test_suite=full, deployment_target=production, generate_evidence=true
Duration: ~30-40 minutes
Output: evidence-pack artifact (ZIP with SBOM, provenance, receipts, etc.)
```

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### Required Artifacts (from atlas-acceptance.yml)
1. ✅ `sbom.json` - CycloneDX SBOM
2. ✅ `provenance.json` - SLSA provenance with signatures
3. ✅ `cosign-verify.txt` - Cosign attestation verification
4. ✅ `headers-report.json` - Security headers validation results
5. ✅ `lhci.json` - Lighthouse CI scores
6. ✅ `k6-summary.json` - Load test metrics
7. ✅ `playwright-report.html` - E2E test results
8. ✅ `receipts/*.json` - RFC 9421 signed receipts
9. ✅ `jwks.json` - JWKS with rotation timestamp
10. ✅ `acceptance.log` - Full test execution log
11. ✅ `acceptance-summary.json` - Test result summary

### Success Criteria
- All workflows complete with status: SUCCESS ✅
- All gates evaluate to: PASS ✅
- Evidence pack contains all 11 required artifacts ✅
- SBOM has valid components and dependencies ✅
- Provenance has valid signatures ✅
- Cosign verification returns "Verified OK" ✅
- Security headers all present and correct ✅
- Lighthouse scores ≥90 for all categories ✅
- k6 p95 latency <500ms, error rate <1% ✅
- Playwright tests 100% pass rate ✅
- JWKS rotation ≤90 days ✅
- RFC 9421 receipts valid ✅

## FIX-UNTIL-GREEN PROTOCOL

If any workflow fails:

1. **Capture Evidence**
   - Screenshot of failure
   - Copy error message from logs
   - Note which step/test failed

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review workflow logs for specific error
   - Check configuration files
   - Verify deployment succeeded before validation

3. **Implement Fix**
   - Update code/configuration
   - Commit to main branch
   - Push changes

4. **Re-Execute Failed Step**
   - Trigger workflow again
   - Verify fix resolved issue
   - Continue to next step

5. **Iterate Until GREEN**
   - Do not proceed with failures
   - Document each iteration
   - Capture final success state
