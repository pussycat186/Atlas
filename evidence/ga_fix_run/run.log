# GA Fix Run Log
**Start Time**: 2025-10-22T16:30:00Z
**Branch**: ga/merge-security-core-20251022-1618
**PR**: #497
**Objective**: Fix CI pnpm mismatch and make PR merge-ready

## A) PRECHECK
✅ Step 1: Fetched all remotes, pruned stale refs
✅ Step 2: On branch ga/merge-security-core-20251022-1618, pulled to 587b34d
❌ Step 3: Node.js toolchain not in PATH

**Decision**: Proceed with Option 3 (CI-only validation)
- Source branch fully validated (31/31 tests)
- Clean merge (zero conflicts)  
- Only fixing CI workflow pnpm version
- GitHub Actions will perform full validation

## B) FIX CI PNPM MISMATCH

### Analysis
Found workflows using pnpm:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Uses `pnpm/action-setup@v3` with `version: 8`
- Multiple other workflows with pnpm install

**Root Cause**: Workflows specify `version: 8` which may pull pnpm 8.x.x (latest)
**Solution**: Pin to exact `version: 8.15.0` to match pnpm-lock.yaml

### Actions Taken
✅ Step 4: Fixed `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Pinned pnpm to 8.15.0 in build-and-test job (line 40)
   - Pinned pnpm to 8.15.0 in sbom-and-provenance job (line 101)
✅ Committed: 96c3112 "fix(ci): pin pnpm to 8.15.0 in release workflow to match lockfile"
✅ Pushed to origin/ga/merge-security-core-20251022-1618

## C) VALIDATE LOCALLY
⏭️ Steps 6-10: SKIPPED (Node.js not in PATH, proceeding with CI-only validation)

## D) PUSH AND RE-RUN CI
✅ Step 11: Pushed workflow fix (commit 96c3112)
⏳ Step 12-13: Awaiting CI checks on PR #497
