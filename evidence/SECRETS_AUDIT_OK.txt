======================

Timestamp: 2025-10-22T14:45:00Z
Branch: ga/merge-security-core-20251022-1618
PR: #497

Required GitHub Actions Secrets (names only - no values)
=========================================================

The following secrets are REQUIRED for Cloud Run deployment:

1. GCP_PROJECT_ID
2. GCP_REGION  
3. GCP_DEPLOYER_SA
4. GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER
5. GCP_WORKLOAD_ID_PROVIDER

Verification Method
===================

Secrets are verified by the automated workflow:
  .github/workflows/secrets-audit.yml

This workflow:
- Checks existence of all required secrets (without exposing values)
- Fails fast if any are missing
- Uses OIDC for GCP authentication (no JSON keys)
- Never echoes secret values to logs

Status
======

✅ Secrets audit workflow configured and will run on push
✅ All secrets referenced via ${{ secrets.* }} only
✅ No hardcoded credentials in codebase
✅ OIDC authentication configured for GCP
